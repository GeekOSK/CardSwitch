# CardSwitch
A Fun Card Switch made with CSS and jQuery. I have not used Keyframes to do this. But I have used class Switching. The idea is sometime while you make a login or Sign up form you need to continuously keep both in the context and screen of the user my idea is basically to transform this idea in a really fun animation motion.

It was inspired by a post on MaterialUp, this is the link to it https://material.uplabs.com/posts/7-1-log-in-sign-up
